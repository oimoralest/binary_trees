    Binary tree
        A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node hast at most
        two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right
        child.

        In coputing, binary trees are used in two very different ways:

        - First, as a means of accessing nodes based on some value or label
        associated with each node. Binary trees labelled this way are used to
        implement binary search trees and binary heaps, and are used for
        efficient searching and sorting.

        - Second, as a representation of data with a relevant bifurcating
        structure. In such cases, the particular arrangement of nodes under
        and/or to the left or right of other nodes is part of the information

        Definitions
            - Recursive: An extended binary tree (binary tree with nodes that
            only have one children empty) is defined as:
                - The empty set is an extended binary tree
                - if T1 and T2 are extended binary trees, then denote T1.T2 the
                extended binary obtained by adding a root r connected to the
                left to T1 and to the right to T2 by adding edges cases when
                these sub-trees non-empty.

            -Graph theory: Binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered
            tree in which every node has at most two children.
